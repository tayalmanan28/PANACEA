# PANACEA

## Course Project for ME 781 [Engineering Data Mining and Applications]

***

## Overview

We are building a web application based on Machine Learning models for prediction of disease based on the symptoms provided by the scans, X -rays and other medical data.

The application will provide the users with portability, instant access to necessary information and quick communication with doctors.


## Implementations: 

This Website helps to predict Heart Diseases, Diabetes, Breast cancer and Some Common diseases like cough, cold, etc. The overall implementation is available on the [Website](https://diseasepredictioniitb.herokuapp.com/)

The Individual Machine Learning Models and their deployments can seen by going through the individual repositories:

1. [Heart Disease Predictor](https://github.com/tayalmanan28/Heart-Disease-Predictor)
2. [Diabetes Predictor](https://github.com/tayalmanan28/Diabetes-Predictor)
3. [Breast Cancer Predictor](https://github.com/tayalmanan28/Breast-Cancer-Predictor)
4. [Common Diseases Predictor](https://github.com/tayalmanan28/Common-Disease-Predictor)
